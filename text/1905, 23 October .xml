To the Editor of The Egyptian Gazette.
Sir,— In the "Bourse Egyptienne” of the 19th
inst.,repeated in the "Phare d'Alexandrie" of
the 20th inst.,under the heading'Bulletin de la
Bourse," a movement is said to be advocated
by a Cairo firm of brokers and a certain
number of local shareholders of the above
company, with a view to suppress the London
board of administration, and to substitute an
Egyptian board of directors to take over the
entire management of the affairs of the com-
pany, on the supposed grounds of continued
friction between the present London and Cairo
boards. I beg to state that this agitation against
the Chairman and London board of directors
does not emanate from the local board, as
such, whose sole members are Mr. Lousdorfer,
Mr. Hooker (ex-managing director), and my-
self. My colleague, Mr. Lousdorfer, has been
absent in Europe since the early days of
September, and does not return to Egypt till
the 7th November, whilst I personally am a
strong supporter of the London board in all
their actions.—Yours faithfully,
H. Crookshank Pasha,
Director </p></div>

<p>A special service was held at St. Mark's
Church, Alexandria, yesterday, and a trophy
and inscription, simple and in excellent taste,
designed by Rear-Admiral Sir Mattie Blom-
field, were erected for the occasion. It consisted
of the famous signal “England expects, eta,"
below which which came the great admiral's
dying words, "For God and my country,” and
the name Horatio Nelson in white letters on
red. In the porch was hung a notice on which
appeared Nelson's portrait and an exact
reproduction in tho international code colors
of his Trafalgar signal, with, an appeal from
tho committee of the Nelson Centenary
Memorial Fund appended. Special hymns were
sung for the occasion, and the Rev. R.

“Oh, King of Kings, whose reign of old.’ </p>

                        <head> DRUSES AND BEDOUINS.</head>
<p>A letter which has reached us from Syria
shows that the stories of a general conflict be-
tween Bedouins and Druses in the Hauran have
been much exaggorated. It appears that a Druse
caravan, while returning to the Hauran from
Damascus some six weeks ago, was attacked
by a gang of Bedouins, and lost two men and
most of its camels. On the news reaching
the Hauran 300 Druse cavaliers decided to
make reprisals. Riding some days over desolate
country in the east of the Hauran, they
surprised the offending tribe and took 700
camels. Two hundred of the raiders returned
with their spoil, the remainder, unsatisfied
with their booty, rode on and captured some
cattle, only to find themselves face to face with
an overwhelming force of Bedouins who had
gathered to repel the attack. Heavily out-
numbered, the hundred Druses had to retire
after two days’ fighting, losing twenty men
and as many horses.</p>
<p> Among the fallen notables were the sons
of Sheikh Selim el Atrash and of Sheikh Said
Nasr both only seventeen years of age. Five
Bedouin leaders were killed. The whole force
of tbe Hauran now prepared to attack the
Bedouins,when Nazn Pasha, Vali of Damasons,
intervened, end the Druses, whose feelings
toward this excellent governor are most
friendly, agreed to submit the dispute to
him for settlement.</p>
<head> OBITUARY. </head>
<head> WILLIAM SHORTLAND RICHARDS.</head>
<p> The sad news comes from Constantinople of
the death of Mr. William Shortland Richards,
H.B.M.'s Consul at Damasous. Mr. Richards
was appointed student interpreter in 1877,
became vice-consul at Mosul in 18 -3 and at
Bourgas in 1885. Ha was then promoted to
be Consul for the E. Coast of the Red Sea
(August 16, 1892) and was attacked and
severely wounded by Bedouins in May, 1895,
receiving compensation from the Turkish Go-
vernment. In 1896 he was transferred to
Damascus. An excellent linguist, a firm and
energeetic consul, always willing to give in-
formation and advice, Mr. Richards won the
respect of all who knew him. The writer has a
very pleasant recollection of the helpful kind-
ness shown him by Mr. Richards, who was
then in very poor health, at Damascus this
year, while the firmness he showed when
called to Beyrout, in the absence on leave
of the Consul-General, during the last disturb
ances, will long be remembered by the peaceable
inhabitants—and by Rashid Bey. </p></div>

<head>KUDSI-JUREIDINI</head>
<p>The marriage of Elias Eff. Kudos, Alexan-
dria correspondent of our contemporary “Al
Mokattam,” with Miss Anissah Jureidini took
place yesterday afternoon at the Orthodox 
church of Saidat El Nijah. After the ceremony '
the bride and bridegroom received the con-
gratulations of their friends at their new house
at Bulkeley, Ramleh. It was a very pleasant
evening to Mr. Kudsi’s numerous friends. The 
wedding presents, which were tasteful and
numerous, were shown in a special room. An
excellent supper crowned the evening. Among
those present were the three well-known poets,
Ahmed Effendi Nessim, Sheikh Shaheem El-
kheze*, and Abbas Eff. Musfi; the latter ex-
temporised some verses which were much
appreciated. Ahmed Effendi Nessim, who acc
ompanied Shahee Bey Macarius from Cairo
to attend the ceremony, then read a long and
pretty poem, which he had composed, and
drank to the health of the Rev. Archimandrite 
Ilia, who was present. </p></div>

<p>On Saturday afternoon a very pleasant en
tertainment was given by the A. R. C. to
celebrate the inauguration of their new shed,
A fair number of visitors were present, in-
cluding H.H. Prince Az’z Hassan, Baron de 
Kugel (who presented the cup trophy to the 
victorious tug of war team). and Messre. Grsf-
ton, M. J. Chini, Guessarian, Martin, di Rosa,
Dr. and Mme Frey, Capt. Phillips. Mr. and
Mrs. Mprs, Mme and Mlle Verita, M. Tassard,
M. Salfarti, Mlle Meyer, Mlle Dalaquis,
and many others. The boat-house had been
very prettily decorated with hunting and the
aquatic sports were most keenly watched
by an appreciative audience.</p>
<p>After a 50 yards race, easily won by Mr.
Seeger, of the Deutacher Sports Verein, came
the greasy pole competition, in which most of
be competitors dived or fell ingloriously into 
the water after the first two steps. The scowling
ended in an easy victory for Mr. Mor, Dr.
Frey steering a bad course which obliged him
to stop short to avoid collision with a lighter.
The competition between "home-made" boats,
few of which supported their occupants for any
length of time, and the blindfold race were
most amusing, especially the latter, some of
the competitors in which, after reaching the
half-way point in a 'there and back’ race of
twenty yards, turned and made courageously
for Fort Agame. The mop tournament was
also most amusing, and the spectacle of one
combatant after another losing his balance and
going over the side was most comic. The
swimming under under water was the last item of an
ejoyable programme.</p>
<p>We may add that an excellent tea and
champagne in generous quantities were provid-
ed and appreciated.</p>

50 yards swimming race—1st, Seeger

                        <div type ="item"><head> FOOTBALL AT PORT SAID.</head>
<head>(Prom our Correspondent.)</head>
<p> Port Said, Saturday.
This afternoon Port Said opened their
football season with a practice match with their
natives. They were short of a few players, but
managed to raise a fall team. The following
represented Port Said: —goal, F. Buck; back,
Wallis (capt.) and Williams ; half-backs, King,
Jones, and Goodwin; forwards, Howe, Ghesman,
Ingram, Gunnery and Jary. In the first half
Port Said were decidedly the better eleven,
and it was marvellous on many occasions
how the native goal escaped downfall.
For full 20 minutes they kept their op-
ponents in their 25 line, and it was only the
very fine play of the backs and goalkeeper
which prevented them scoring. Towards the
end of the first half the natives got away with
a rush and after some splendid passing the
ball found the net, but whether it was a
native or King, (the Port said half-back) who
actually scored, it is hard to say, but it
certainly was no fault of the goalkeeper. The
second half was contested at as fast a pace as
before, and again Port Said attacked, but- the
shooting was very poor. Neither tide scored,
and when the whistle went for time, the
score remained as at half-time.
There wire several "new faces" in the Port
Said string who gave promise, but on the whole
play was not of a scientific order. Gunnery,
Ingram, Jary and Williams were prominent
for Port Said, while the right wing was the
backbone of the natives.</p>
<p> A football match was played at Boulac on
Friday last, between the home team and the
R.A.M.C., in the presence of fully 150 specta-
tors. Boulac lost the toss and kicked off from
the Embabeh end. Before the game was a few
minutes' old, it soon became evident that
Boulac were the stronger team in every
respect, and they consequently won after an
easy’ but enjoyable game, by 10 goals to nil.
The goal scorers for Boulac were: Mr. C. J.
Esau, 5; Mr. J. Rodway, 2 ; Mr. L. II. Lion, 1;
Mr. W. M. Hates. 1.</p>
<p>After the match was over, tea was provided
for the players, and thus ended another of those
pleasant afternoons which are so frequent at
Boulac. </p></div>
